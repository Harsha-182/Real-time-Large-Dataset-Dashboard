### Project Title: Real-Time Large Dataset Dashboard

#### Overview
Provide a brief description of the project, its purpose, and the problem it solves.

Example:
> This project is a scalable, high-performance dashboard designed to handle large datasets (2GB+) in real-time, incorporating role-based access control, efficient data processing, and a clean user interface. It allows users to upload large datasets, view real-time analytics, and manage access permissions based on roles.

### Features
- **Real-time data streaming and visualisation**
- **Role-based access control (RBAC)**
- **Efficient processing of large datasets (2GB+)**
- **Batch processing and background task handling**
- **Secure user authentication and authorisation**
- **Optimised frontend for large datasets (virtualisation, lazy loading)**

---

### Project Architecture

Describe the overall architecture, covering each major component and their roles in the system. Use a diagram if possible.

Example:
> The project is designed using a microservices-inspired architecture:
> - **Backend (Node.js/Express)**: Handles authentication, authorisation, data processing, and API management.
> - **Database (MongoDB/PostgreSQL)**: Stores processed data with optimisations for large dataset handling.
> - **Queue System (Redis + Bull)**: Manages background tasks for efficient data processing.
> - **Frontend (React/Next.js)**: Provides a responsive dashboard with real-time data visualisation.
> - **WebSocket/SSE**: Enables real-time data streaming to the client.

---

### Technology Stack
List the primary technologies and libraries used.

Example:
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, JWT, Bull (Redis for queuing)
- **Database**: MongoDB/PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React, Next.js, Chart.js/D3.js
- **Real-Time**: WebSockets/SSE
- **Deployment**: Vercel

---

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/project-name.git
   ```
   
2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Backend `.env` example:
     ```plaintext
     REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
     ```
   - Frontend `.env` example:
     ```plaintext
     NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3000
     ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   - Backend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```
   - Frontend:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     ```

### Usage Instructions

Provide any instructions for logging in and using the features (e.g., demo credentials for different roles).

---

### Role-Based Access Control
Explain how role-based access control is set up.

Example:
> - **Admin**: Full access to data and user management
> - **Manager**: Access to specific datasets
> - **User**: Read-only access to data visualisations
> RBAC is implemented using middleware on specific routes. Only authorised roles have access to certain actions, like uploading datasets or viewing restricted data.

---

### API Endpoints

List and describe each endpoint, its purpose, parameters, and expected responses. 

Example:
- **`POST /api/auth/login`**: Authenticates user and returns a JWT token.
- **`GET /api/data`**: Retrieves paginated data based on user role.
- **`POST /api/data/upload`**: Allows admins to upload new datasets.

---

### Real-Time Data Handling

Explain how real-time features are implemented.

Example:
> Real-time data updates are managed via WebSockets (or Server-Sent Events). Upon new data processing, the server pushes updates to the client, allowing for live dashboard updates without manual refreshes.

---

### Task Breakdown

Provide a breakdown of the tasks undertaken to build the project. Include estimated time spent on each task.

Example:
- **Setting up backend with Express.js and PostgreSQL**:
- **Implementing JWT authentication**: 
- **Data processing and background task handling**:
- **Frontend development (React/Next.js)**:
- **WebSocket/SSE setup for real-time streaming**:
- **Testing and deployment (AWS, Vercel)**: 

---

### Assumptions & Limitations

Describe any assumptions made during development and limitations of the current solution.

Example:
- **Assumptions**: Data files will be in a standard CSV format. Roles are predefined (Admin, Manager, User).
- **Limitations**: Current setup does not support auto-scaling on AWS but can be modified for future enhancements.

---

### Future Improvements

Provide ideas for future upgrades and enhancements.

Example:
- Add support for additional file formats.
- Implement auto-scaling for backend services.
- Enhance data security with additional encryption measures.
